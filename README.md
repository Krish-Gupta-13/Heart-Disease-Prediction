Heart Disease Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is suffering from heart disease based on various features. The model utilizes logistic regression and achieves an accuracy of nearly 80%.

Overview
The model was developed using a dataset containing information about patients, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar levels, electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise, and the presence or absence of heart disease.

Data Cleaning
The dataset underwent a thorough cleaning process to handle missing values and ensure data quality. This included imputing missing values, removing duplicate entries, and correcting data formats.

Preprocessing
Before training the model, the features were standardized to scale them to a comparable range, which is essential for models like logistic regression that are sensitive to the scale of the input features.

Visualization
Various graphs were created to visualize the data distribution, explore relationships between features, and visualize the model's performance. These visualizations help in understanding the dataset better and interpreting the model's predictions.
